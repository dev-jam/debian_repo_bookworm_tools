Description: system tray notifications for Thunderbird
 Birdtray provides systray notifications for Thunderbird.  It displays the
 count of unread mail, hides the Thunderbird window when not in use, and
 restores it on clicking the tray icon.  It also provides a context menu
 with commands such as starting composing a new mail.
 .
 It is a nasty hack -- an external process looking at Thunderbird's
 insides, it suffers from problems like noticing new mails only after a
 delay, having to restart Thunderbird just to hide its window, etc --
 you'd want to use an extension like firetray instead -- but, it is
 likely that support for Thunderbird XUL extensions will be dropped soon,
 possibly by the time you read these words.

Description: delete unnecessary files from the system
 BleachBit deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space, maintain
 privacy, and remove junk. It removes cache, Internet history, temporary files,
 cookies, and broken shortcuts.
 .
 It handles cleaning of Adobe Reader, Bash, Beagle, Epiphany, Firefox, Flash,
 GIMP, Google Earth, Java, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Opera, RealPlayer, rpmbuild,
 Second Life Viewer, VIM, XChat, and more.
 .
 Beyond simply erasing junk files, BleachBit wipes free disk space (to hide
 previously deleted files for privacy and to improve compression of images),
 vacuums Firefox databases (to improve performance without deleting data), and
 securely shreds arbitrary files.

Description: GUI utility to change the CPU frequency
 This utility can change the operating frequency of the CPU for
 each core separately. Additionally, the cpu governor can be changed.
 The program can detect offline cores and only present the available ones.
 Furthermore, if a core doesn't support frequency scaling is not shown.
 There is also an option to apply the same settings to all cores simultaneously.
 To apply the settings, the user must be local and active,
 as well as in group sudo. Local and active users not in this group must
 authenticate themselves as admin in order to apply the settings.

Description: miscellaneous plugins for Geany
 This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an
 individual plugin, but might still be useful for people.
  * DocList: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
    offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
    Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
    switch to them.
  * OpenURI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when
    the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser
    command configured in Geany to open it.
  * Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
    lines with "TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words
    and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task
    in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.
  * Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and
    provides a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used
    to quickly show and hide the Geany main window.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.

Description: auto-closing plugin for Geany
 This plugin enables auto-closing features. Auto-closing works while you typing
 and intellectually helps you to write code.
 .
 Features:
  * auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
  * customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
  * delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
  * suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
    "{}}")
  * enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
    text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
  * keep selection when enclosing
  * for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
    (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
  * enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
  * for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
    precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that
    selection covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
  * fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
  * auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
  * auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression

Description: ctags plugin for Geany
 GeanyCtags adds a simple support for generating and querying ctags files
 for a Geany project.
 .
 Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the
 open files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag
 regeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this
 plugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once
 and just query it when searching for a particular symbol
 definition/declaration. This approach is fine for big projects where most
 of the codebase remains unchanged and the tag positions remain more or
 less static.

Description: macro plugin for Geany
 Geanymacro is a plugin to provide user defined macros for Geany.
 This plugin allows you to record and use your own macros. Macros are
 sequences of actions that can then be repeated with a single key
 combination. So if you had dozens of lines where you wanted to delete
 the last 2 characters, you could simple start recording, press End,
 Backspace, Backspace, down line and then stop recording. Then simply
 trigger the macro and it would automatically edit the line and move to
 the next.

 insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
 encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.

Description: Cross Platform Password Manager
 KeePassXC is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
 to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your
 passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a
 key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or
 insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
 encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.
 .
 In contrast to KeePassX (package keepassx), KeePassXC is actively developed
 and has more features, e.g., connectivity to a Web Browser plugin (package
 webext-keepassxc-browser).
 .
 This package includes all plugins, including networking, and various IPC
 like browser integration, ssh agent, freedesktop.org secret storage. Use
 at your own risk.

 .
  - Fast: can read or write gigabytes per second JSON data on modern CPUs.
  - Portable: complies with ANSI C (C89) for cross-platform compatibility.
  - Strict: complies with RFC 8259 JSON standard, ensuring strict number format
    and UTF-8 validation.
  - Extendable: offers options to allow comments, trailing commas, NaN/Inf, and
    custom memory allocator.
  - Accuracy: can accurately read and write int64, uint64, and double numbers.
  - Flexible: supports unlimited JSON nesting levels, \u0000 characters, and non
    null-terminated strings.
  - Manipulation: supports querying and modifying using JSON Pointer, JSON Patch

Description: multithreaded PAR 2.0 compatible file verification and repair tool
 par2cmdline-turbo is a command line utility for creating and using PAR2 files
 to detect and repair damage in data files. It is most commonly used as
 part of backup systems as well as on Usenet. This version differs from the
 regular par2 by enhancements from parpar to increase performance.
 .
 In case files in a recovery set get damaged (e.g. while transmitted over
 a network or stored on a faulty disk) the program can read the damaged
 files and the (possibly damaged) PAR2 files, and regenerate the original
 input files.
